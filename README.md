## 🤖 AI Tool Used

This project was created using **Lovable.dev** (https://lovable.dev), an AI-powered website builder that generated the initial design and React components.

### What I Changed Manually

After generating the initial design with Lovable, I:

1. **Converted from React to pure HTML/CSS**: 
   - Transformed React components into semantic HTML structure
   - Converted Tailwind CSS classes to custom CSS
   - Implemented JavaScript for mobile menu functionality

2. **Customized the Color Scheme**:
   - Changed from navy/gold to purple/pink gradient theme
   - Added custom CSS variables for consistent theming

3. **Enhanced Animations**:
   - Added floating animation to hero name
   - Implemented card shine effect on hover
   - Added gentle glow pulse animations
   - Created smooth transitions for all interactive elements

4. **Improved Responsiveness**:
   - Refined mobile hamburger menu
   - Optimized grid layouts for different screen sizes
   - Adjusted typography scaling for better readability

5. **Optimized Performance**:
   - Removed unnecessary dependencies
   - Used pure CSS instead of animation libraries
   - Implemented smooth scroll behavior

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Download both `portfolio.html` and `portfolio.css` files
